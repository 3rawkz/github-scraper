Have you ever wanted to know who are the **best people** online
**to follow** and ***why***?

- Who posts interesting content and who doesn't?
- Who is "**trending**" and ***why***?

I wonder this all the time.
So I'm building ***fuata*** (working title) to [***scratch my own itch***](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Whats_Your_Problem.php).
